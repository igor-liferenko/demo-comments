//!

//! @section intro License

//! Use of this program is subject to Atmel's End User License Agreement.

//!

//! Please read file  \ref lic_page for copyright notice.

//!

//! @section install Description

//! This embedded application source code illustrates how to implement a CDC application

//! with the ATmega32U4 controller.

//!

//! @section sample About the sample application

//! The sample code is delivered for EVK527.

//!

//! This application will enumerates as a CDC (communication device class) virtual COM port. The application

//! can be used as a USB to serial converter. 

//!

//! @section src_code About the source code

//! This source code is usable with the following compilers:

//! - IAR Embedded Workbench (5.11A and higher)

//! - AVRGCC (WinAVR 20080610 and higher).

//!

//! Support for other compilers may required modifications or attention for:

//! - compiler.h file 

//! - special registers declaration file

//! - interrupt subroutines declarations

//!

//! @section chg Changes

//! 2.0.1: Now does not allow to send data before end enumeration AND open port detection.

//!

//! @section arch Architecture

//! As illustrated in the figure bellow, the application entry point is located is the main.c file.

//! The main function first performs the initialization of a scheduler module and then runs it in an infinite loop.

//! The scheduler is a simple infinite loop calling all its tasks defined in the conf_scheduler.h file.

//! No real time schedule is performed, when a task ends, the scheduler calls the next task defined in

//! the configuration file (conf_scheduler.h).

//!

//! The sample dual role application is based on two different tasks:

//! - The usb_task  (usb_task.c associated source file), is the task performing the USB low level

//! enumeration process in device mode.

//! - The cdc task performs the loop back application between USB and USART interfaces.
